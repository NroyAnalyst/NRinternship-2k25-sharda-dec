#Now Load the dataset in jupyter notebook

next i find the information of data like datatypes and is there any value is null or not and how many data rows are there.

in next Step i find the statistical measures for the data.

After this i use value_counts for how many survived and how many not, counts by passenger class, How many females and males are there.

Next i find a numerical relationship between data like Age, Fare and Survived using pairplot.

Next is Heatmap which shows how data is correlated to each other.

Next i use histogram for finding Age distribution of passengers.

Here i use Boxplot for visualization of fare vs survival.

Next is Scatterplot which presents the Non-survivors scattered in all age and higher survivors are from higher payers.

Next is count plot which shows Survivors by genders.

Next is also a count plot which shows the higher class have high Survivors and lower class has less survivors.

Summary: Higher class passengers had better survival, Fare is positively related to survival, Children had better survival chance.

Conclusion: After did the exploratory data analysis i found that Titanic survivals based on social factors where women and children were prioritized, who paid more survived more.

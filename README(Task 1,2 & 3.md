#Task 1

import Pandas and Numpy to store data and perform specific task on data using python it helps to perform multiple mathematical functions on data.

print statement is used to print any statement which is written in double quotation, like here i used to print Missing values.
print(df.null().sum()) is used to find null values from whole data and also sum that how much the null values are.

Here first line is use to drop null/NaN values and duplicate values from the data frame

#Task 2

Here in Task 2 we import libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipuation and Uploading data into DataFrame, and library Matplotlib and Seaborn is use to draw and make plot like Bar Chart, Pi Chart, Scatter Plot, Trend lines etc.

<img width="318" height="96" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5829308-b119-46df-a718-4519f86201bb" />

Here import data from storgae and find null values from data and aggregate then column wise.

<img width="574" height="456" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa70114-4d75-46bb-a124-b280fcf6d44b" />

First remove Null/NaN values from data which is helpful for further statistical analysis, Ml modelling and improve accuracy.
Removing duplicates avoide biasness caused by repeated records, ensures accurate aggregation and modeling.
Next line of code is set the Background of plot white with grid lined for good view and Muted palette is used for soft and professional colours for best viewing experience. Fig size ansures the length and width of chart.

<img width="481" height="141" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55b61661-a129-460e-a256-6d880b72f8e3" />

In this we change the Order_Date in Datetime Means Date format from DD-MM-YYYY into YYYY-MM-DD format.

<img width="454" height="68" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80921b74-096e-4041-ad84-ef9ad4da9d01" />

Below written code is used to plot a graph for sales and profit over time, here we can visualize the sales and profit trend analysis.

<img width="755" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dcad5a7-c102-418d-b4a8-2eed11f91eaa" />

#Task 3

Open MySql workbench 8.0 and type the below attached Query to create a DataBase.

<img width="617" height="106" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6297548b-9917-4f0f-9e25-8c48773b8f6c" />

Then write below attached querty to create a Table in supermart_db.

<img width="629" height="673" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b8fda95-cc6c-40aa-979d-88445c6e582e" />

After creating table we have to import data from csv file and also convert/modify the data types into Sql supported data using below query, which helps to  modify column into YYYY-MM-DD format.

<img width="623" height="171" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc0fd71d-8626-4613-a3b8-c0f89c620cbb" />

To import data from some csv file which is stored in your storage unit we can use two way first is mentioned below. first we have to right click on superstore table and then on import wizard tab.

<img width="409" height="647" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df954c9b-4c27-4e4b-9665-a538278ec189" />

Then click on browse and select the file path where it stored here i'm using Superstore.csv data. then click next and next and your data is start importing.

<img width="971" height="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68c48fad-88b3-45a9-8563-e4fce0c5db72" />

After importing here is the stored data in your created table.

<img width="1344" height="368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57371197-a200-4ea4-b710-9f55ea072732" />

After importing data i performed queries which is mentioned in the Task 3 the first one is use of Select, where, Order By, Group By queries. 

<img width="625" height="515" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23c4ca2a-f234-4e21-a092-0c94f1861913" />

Then by wriring sql queries i find the top 5 costumers profit wise.

<img width="622" height="525" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1318a97-ef61-41eb-8cbb-5080a75c433d" />

--JOINS OPERATIONS--

To perform Inner joins operation like Left Join, Right Join we have to create multiple tables so here we create some dimentions table for products and customers.

<img width="678" height="260" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f8d0a5-fb8c-4977-b7ab-790535a463c3" />

Inner Join Operation- Sales by customers segment

<img width="678" height="505" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e77056f4-0c41-4a65-932b-f3f5d54d42f3" />

Left Join- Product with or without sales

<img width="673" height="680" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9938963-76b9-4748-87d2-b40eb2ff8e85" />

Right Join- Customers and their Orders.

<img width="676" height="686" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4547509-6347-4f6f-bc09-8aede8841b36" />

--SUBQUERIES--

Customers which are having sales more than average sales value.

<img width="680" height="697" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec1eddd3-cd98-49f7-9f3d-b72dd72462e9" />

--AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS (AVG, SUM)--

Sum of Total quantity sold per region.

<img width="685" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86c2fb60-ad98-491c-a82e-df94ebe3cf4b" />

Here by using queries i find the average discount category wise.

<img width="676" height="395" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79802fc5-dad1-4592-8aea-b78eaf403e15" />

--CREATE VIEW FOR ANALYSIS--

By running the below mwntioned query we make a table of sales_performance where we can view thw sales and profit by category and Region wise.

<img width="755" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2bd5db4-9a9c-4426-b536-1a18a3844586" />

by writing this query i find here the monthly and yearly sales as you can see in left side of the screenshot there is a schema in the schemas there is view section and view section we have created a table for monthly_sales
